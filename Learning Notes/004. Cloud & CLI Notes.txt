Section 4 notes on Command Line and Cloud DBT

This will run the specific folder of example
dbt run --models example

This will run the specific sql file
dbt run --models dates

This will specify multiple models to run
dbt run --models example.dates example.my_first_dbt_model

CLOUD
https://cloud.getdbt.com/

Notes:
When setting up: account is the url / region and number
Once you've linked the project you have to add connections to snowflake as well as your git repo.
This will include using an SSH key.
The final project will have the repository and connection set up as if the dbt has a sub repository.
deployment credentials here refer to the cloud login.

To add the key you go to github, settings, deploy key.

CREATING AN ENVIRONMENT
Set up an environment, with the snowflake connection that has been set up.
deployment credentials here are different - it is the transform_user and pass found in the profiles.yml

This will set up the environment to run from the cloud as oppose to the command line.

JOBS
You can then set up a job with the required CLI requests as well as set triggers.
The job will be added to the queue and then execute. It will flag any errors.
Any changes you make you will need to repush back to the repo before re running in the cloud console.
