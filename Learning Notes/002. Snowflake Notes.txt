Section 3.
CREATING NEW MODELS (E.G snowflake_customer_purchases)

General:
-- create new sql script within the models folder
-- put whether it should be a view or a table
-- add the model to the schema
dbt run

GRANT
Within Snowflake, make sure to check users accessibility through roles and grants.
Initially I had not had this set up correctly as I could only create views but not tables.
You will also want to check what the default database is.

grant create schema on database analytics to role transform_role ;
grant usage on all schemas in database analytics to role transform_role ;
grant usage on future schemas in database analytics to role transform_role ;
grant select on all tables in database analytics to role transform_role ;
grant select on future tables in database analytics to role transform_role ;
grant select on all views in database analytics to role transform_role ;
grant select on future views in database analytics to role transform_role ;

Within warehouse on snowflake, you must make sure it grants the ability to create tables!
