HOOKS
run specific commands before or after models

Within your dbt_project file you can add the following syntax, which would allow usage for the role.

on run-end:
  - 'grant usage on schema analytics.dbt to role analyst'

You can add post hooks into the models.
models:
  cjtests_learn_dbt:
    # Config indicated by + and applies to all files under models/example/
    example:
      materialized: table
    vars:
      my_variable: 1
    post-hook: 'grant usage on schema {{target.this}} to role analyst'
    post-hook: 'grant select on {{this}} to role analyst'

You can also have triggers at the start.
on run-start:
    - "query to be executed"

SNAPSHOT
You can add snapshots into your dbt to create a log of current states for different tables/ID's
